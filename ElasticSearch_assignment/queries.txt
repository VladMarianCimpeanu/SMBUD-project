# PERCENTAGE FULL COVERAGE VACCINATION
    It calculates the percentage of people which has already completed the vaccination cycle.
    The percentage is calculated in respect to all the vaccinated people, so all the people that has already received
    at least one dose.
    The cycle is considered completed if:
        - if one is vaccinated with Janssen vaccine.
        - if one has already received the second dose.
